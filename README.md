# Idea Of The Project 

- this is a project for my second year of college, it uses Java Swing and AWT Libraries to make a university management system desktop application, it's just a simple copy of what is should be able to do

## design and features of the app :
1. It has a login page
2. logout page
3. assignments page
4. admin dashboard *not fully functional though, it can onpy add lectures* 
5. Lectures page
6. courses page *with the courses that i take at the college* :)

**it doesn't have any database!** it sounds weird but the requirements did not include database, i stored the data in HashMaps and ArrayLists 
**Adding lectures function** as mentioned in the admin page 
**Able to display the registered lectures in the local lectures varibales** also to mention in the course page it can display the associated lectures within every course 
**login system** for the admins and for normal student, but it's not good :)
